# How to Develop TensorBoard

## Launching a Development Instance

Run the following to launch a demo of TensorBoard in raw sources mode:

```sh
bazel run third_party/tensorflow/tensorboard/components/tf_tensorboard:demo
```

Now you can navigate to <http://localhost:6006/demo/index.html> and play with
the demo TensorBoard instance. This will have live source reloading.

This demo TensorBoard will have a small amount of demo data generated by
[generate_testdata.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/scripts/generate_testdata.py).
You can use [serialize_tensorboard.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/scripts/serialize_tensorboard.py)
to create a realistic demo directory from your own data files.

## Launching TensorBoard Proper

Running TensorBoard automatically asks Bazel to create a vulcanized HTML binary:

```sh
bazel run //tensorflow/tensorboard:tensorboard -- --logdir=/path/to/logs
```
